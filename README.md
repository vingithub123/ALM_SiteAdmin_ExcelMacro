# ALM_SiteAdmin_AddUsers_Utility

This excel macro utility is created to add new user and assign them to new project and groups in ALM.
Using 'User_ALM_Details.xlsx' file, you first need to get user's details like ProjectID, FirstName, LastName, and Team.
In this example, the 'yourALMDomain', 'yourALMProject' values are hardcoded in the excel macro to which the new users are added, these values can be parameterized and input from excel file.
Finally after user creation, an e-mail is sent to the each user present in the excel file.
